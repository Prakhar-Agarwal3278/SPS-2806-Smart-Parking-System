Smart Parking System
Prakhar Agarwal
Here , using TinkerCad , we have tried to simulate a smart Parking system using Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors and 2 LED's.
Here whenever a car is found to be present in the parking, red LED glows representing no space, and as soon as the car goes of the parking we get to see a Green light.
Instead of using two LED here we could hace also directly used the RGB Led but thats the same thing.
